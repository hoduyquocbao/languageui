**DATE:** 2025-06-25
**SUBJECT:** Icon System Expansion with Line/Filled/Social Categories

---

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-033: Icon Asset Classification:** Successfully organized all SVG assets into three categories: line (11 icons), filled (12 icons), and social (4 icons). All line and filled icons use `currentColor` for dynamic theming, while social icons retain their brand colors.
- **TODO-034: Icon Component Enhancement:** Upgraded the Icon component to support a `kind` prop (line/filled/social) instead of `type`, using a nested structure that eliminates multi-word type aliases and maintains strict TypeScript compliance.
- **TODO-035: Showcase Integration:** Enhanced the Showcase with three new sections displaying all icons by category, with social icons presented on dark backgrounds to showcase brand colors effectively.
- **TODO-036: Codebase Cleanup:** Confirmed no Figma-generated TSX files remain in the codebase, maintaining architectural integrity.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Categorical Organization:** Icons are now organized into semantic categories (line, filled, social) rather than a flat structure, improving maintainability and discoverability.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Line and filled icons use `currentColor` for seamless theme integration, while social icons preserve their brand identity through fixed colors.
- **Type Safety:** Eliminated multi-word type aliases in favor of a generic Props interface that ensures `kind` and `name` compatibility through TypeScript's discriminated unions.
- **Performance Optimization:** All icons continue to use React.lazy for code-splitting, ensuring optimal bundle size and loading performance.

### 3. FINAL COMMIT HASH

The final commit hash for this body of work is: `003c866596981fdedf8a7d6bd31ac99858a95b9f`

All knowledge bases (`todo.csv`, `architecture.csv`, `memories.csv`) have been updated to reflect these changes and are now fully synchronized with the current system state. The system is stable and ready for the next set of instructions.

**SUBJECT:** Form Molecule Layer Implementation

---

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-037: Icon Asset Addition:** Successfully added two new icons (chevron-down, check) to the line icons category for form components, with proper currentColor theming.
- **TODO-038: Input Component:** Built a comprehensive Input component with Wrapper, Field, Prefix, and Suffix components, supporting prefix/suffix icons, focus states, and disabled states.
- **TODO-039: Checkbox Component:** Created a Checkbox component with Hidden, Box, and Wrapper components, featuring a check icon from line icons and proper checked/disabled states.
- **TODO-040: Form Components Completion:** Implemented four additional form components: Textarea, Radio, Toggle, and Select, all following single-word naming conventions.
- **TODO-041: Showcase Enhancement:** Added a comprehensive "Form Controls" section to the Showcase, displaying all form components with various states (default, checked, disabled).
- **TODO-042: Codebase Cleanup:** Confirmed no Figma-generated TSX form files remain in the codebase, maintaining architectural integrity.

### 2. FORM MOLECULE REFINEMENT TASKS

- **TODO-043: Input Refinement:** Verified that the Input component already supports prefix/suffix icons within the input field as required by the Figma design.
- **TODO-044: Checkbox Refinement:** Confirmed that the Checkbox component has the correct structure with Hidden, Box, and Wrapper components, using the check icon from line icons.
- **TODO-045: Toggle Refinement:** Validated that the Toggle component has the proper switch interface with Track, Thumb, and Hidden components as specified in the Figma design.
- **TODO-046: Showcase Update:** Confirmed that the Form Controls section in the Showcase already matches the specifications from Task.md, displaying all form components with proper states and examples.
- **TODO-047: Codebase Cleanup:** Verified that no Figma-generated TSX files remain in the codebase, maintaining clean architectural integrity.

### 3. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Molecule Layer Introduction:** Successfully established a new architectural layer for form controls and interactive components that combine multiple atoms.
- **Single-Word Compliance:** All form components strictly follow the single-word naming convention, using components like Wrapper, Field, Prefix, Suffix, Hidden, Box, Track, Thumb.
- **Theme-Driven Design:** All components use theme tokens exclusively, with no hardcoded values, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
- **Adapter Integration:** All components use the adapter layer for React types (Node instead of ReactNode) and styled-components, maintaining architectural consistency.
- **Accessibility:** Components include proper accessibility features such as hidden native inputs for form controls and appropriate ARIA attributes.

### 4. FINAL COMMIT HASH

The final commit hash for this body of work is: `e86a9ff`

All knowledge bases (`todo.csv`, `architecture.csv`, `memories.csv`) have been updated to reflect these changes and are now fully synchronized with the current system state. The Form Molecule layer is complete and ready for production use.
