**SUBJECT:** Asset System: Dynamic Logo Component & Showcase Upgrade

---

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-022: SVG Asset Extraction:** All logo variants were extracted from the Figma TSX file and saved as clean SVGs in `src/assets/logos`.
- **TODO-023: Dynamic Logo Component:** Built a single `Logo` component that loads the correct SVG variant (icon/full, light/dark) on demand, using code-splitting for performance.
- **TODO-024: Showcase Upgrade:** The `Showcase` page now displays all logo variants in a dedicated section, ensuring visual verification and documentation.
- **TODO-025: Cleanup:** No Figma TSX logo file remains in the codebase; all assets are now managed systematically.
- **Build Verification:** The project builds successfully after all changes.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Asset Decoupling:** All logo assets are now managed as separate SVG files, not inline or bundled in TSX. This enables maintainability, performance, and strict architectural compliance.
- **Dynamic Loading:** The `Logo` component uses React.lazy and Suspense to load only the required SVG, minimizing bundle size.
