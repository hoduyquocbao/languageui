### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-026: Button Enhancement:** The atomic Button component was fully refactored to support all variants, sizes, and states, using only theme tokens and the adapter layer. No hardcoded values remain.
- **TODO-027: Showcase Upgrade:** The Showcase page now includes a comprehensive "Buttons" section, visually demonstrating all Button variants and states for live verification.
- **TODO-028: Cleanup:** No Figma TSX button file remains in the codebase; all code is now systematic and architectural-compliant.
- **Build Verification:** The project builds successfully after all changes.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Strict Adapter Use:** All styling and logic for Button now go through the adapter and theme, ensuring future-proofing and maintainability.
- **No Hardcoded Styles:** All color, spacing, and typography are sourced from the theme object.
- **Showcase as Living Guide:** The new Buttons section in Showcase provides a live, always-up-to-date style guide for all button states.
