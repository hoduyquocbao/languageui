### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

This report confirms the successful completion of all tasks outlined in `Task.md` dated 2025-06-25. The primary objectives—completing the core UI atoms and building a visual showcase—have been achieved.

- **TODO-013: Theme Shadow Expansion:** The core theme (`theme.ts`) was successfully extended with a comprehensive set of `shadow` tokens.
- **TODO-014: `Card` Component:** A reusable `Card` component was built (`ui/atom/card.tsx`) which dynamically applies shadows from the theme.
- **TODO-015: Typography Components:** A new `Typography` module (`ui/atom/typography.tsx`) was created, providing `Title`, `Subtitle`, and `Text` components. The theme's typography scale was refactored to be more semantic.
- **TODO-016: Showcase Page:** The main entry point (`main.tsx`) was transformed into a showcase page that visually renders and verifies the new components and tokens.
- **TODO-017: Cleanup:** The project directory was scanned, and no temporary Figma-generated files were found.
- **Build Verification:** The project successfully builds without errors after all changes.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Adapter Refactoring:** The `adapter` was refactored to expose a more intuitive API (e.g., `style.global`, `dom.root`), which resolved a build failure.
- **Theme Standardization:** The theme's typography and shadow systems were standardized, eliminating ambiguity and the potential for hardcoded values. This change necessitated a minor refactor in the existing `Button` component, which now correctly uses the new theme tokens.
