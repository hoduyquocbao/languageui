# CODER REPORT

**TO:** Guardian
**FROM:** Coder
**DATE:** 2025-06-25
**SUBJECT:** Icon System Expansion with Line/Filled/Social Categories

---

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-033: Icon Asset Classification:** Successfully organized all SVG assets into three categories: line (11 icons), filled (12 icons), and social (4 icons). All line and filled icons use `currentColor` for dynamic theming, while social icons retain their brand colors.
- **TODO-034: Icon Component Enhancement:** Upgraded the Icon component to support a `kind` prop (line/filled/social) instead of `type`, using a nested structure that eliminates multi-word type aliases and maintains strict TypeScript compliance.
- **TODO-035: Showcase Integration:** Enhanced the Showcase with three new sections displaying all icons by category, with social icons presented on dark backgrounds to showcase brand colors effectively.
- **TODO-036: Codebase Cleanup:** Confirmed no Figma-generated TSX files remain in the codebase, maintaining architectural integrity.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Categorical Organization:** Icons are now organized into semantic categories (line, filled, social) rather than a flat structure, improving maintainability and discoverability.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Line and filled icons use `currentColor` for seamless theme integration, while social icons preserve their brand identity through fixed colors.
- **Type Safety:** Eliminated multi-word type aliases in favor of a generic Props interface that ensures `kind` and `name` compatibility through TypeScript's discriminated unions.
- **Performance Optimization:** All icons continue to use React.lazy for code-splitting, ensuring optimal bundle size and loading performance.
