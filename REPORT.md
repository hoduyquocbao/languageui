**SUBJECT:** Completion of Design Token System and Showcase Upgrade

---

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

This report confirms the successful completion of all tasks outlined in `Task.md` regarding the design token system and showcase upgrade.

- **TODO-018: Theme Color Overhaul:** The core theme (`theme.ts`) was successfully updated with a complete and structured color palette, extracted from Figma data.
- **TODO-019: `Swatch` Component:** A reusable `Swatch` component was built (`ui/atom/swatch.tsx`) to visually represent colors in the style guide.
- **TODO-020: Showcase Upgrade:** The `Showcase` page was significantly upgraded. It now dynamically renders the entire color palette from the theme, alongside the existing shadow display.
- **TODO-021: Cleanup:** The codebase was scanned, and no auto-generated Figma files were found that required deletion.
- **Build Verification:** A build failure related to the `Button` component's use of outdated color tokens was identified and resolved. The project now builds successfully.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Theme as Single Source of Truth:** The `theme.color` object is now the definitive source for all color values, eliminating the risk of hardcoded colors and ensuring consistency.
- **Dynamic Showcase:** The showcase is no longer a static page but a "live" style guide that directly visualizes the project's design tokens, ensuring that the documentation is always in sync with the implementation.

### 3. FINAL COMMIT HASH

The final commit hash for this body of work is: `[COMMIT_HASH_PLACEHOLDER]`

All knowledge bases (`todo.csv`, `architecture.csv`, `memories.csv`) have been updated to reflect these changes. The system is stable and ready for the next set of instructions.
