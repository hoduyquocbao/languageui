**SUBJECT:** Dynamic Icon System & Showcase Enhancement

### 1. SUMMARY OF COMPLETED TASKS

- **TODO-029: Icon Asset Extraction:** All icon variants were extracted from the Figma TSX file and saved as clean SVGs in `src/assets/icons`, with fill set to `currentColor`.
- **TODO-030: Dynamic Icon Component:** Built a single `Icon` component that loads the correct SVG variant on demand, using React.lazy for code-splitting and performance.
- **TODO-031: Showcase Upgrade:** The `Showcase` page now displays all icon variants in a dedicated section, ensuring visual verification and documentation.
- **TODO-032: Cleanup:** No Figma TSX icon file remains in the codebase; all assets are now managed systematically.
- **Build Verification:** The project builds successfully after all changes.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & CHANGES

- **Asset Decoupling:** All icon assets are now managed as separate SVG files, not inline or bundled in TSX. This enables maintainability, performance, and strict architectural compliance.
- **Dynamic Loading:** The `Icon` component uses React.lazy and Suspense to load only the required SVG, minimizing bundle size.
- **Showcase as Living Guide:** The new Icons section in Showcase provides a live, always-up-to-date style guide for all icon states.
