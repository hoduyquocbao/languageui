1,Technology,UI,-,"Framework Selection","Selection of the foundational web framework for the project.","Choose React.","React's component-based architecture aligns well with the SRP and decomposition principles required for single-word naming. Its vast ecosystem provides tools for performance optimization at scale.",2025-06-24T19:15:00Z
2,Technology,Build,Vite,"SVG Handling","How to handle SVG assets as reusable React components.","Use `vite-plugin-svgr`.","This plugin integrates seamlessly with Vite's build process, allowing direct import of SVGs as components (`import ... from './icon.svg?react'`), which is efficient and type-safe.",2025-06-27T10:00:00Z
3,Technology,Styling,UI,"CSS-in-JS Strategy","Choosing a library for component-level styling that integrates with React and a design token system.","Use `styled-components`.","It allows for creating styled primitive components, has excellent TypeScript support, and works naturally with a `ThemeProvider` to consume design tokens from `theme.ts`.",2025-06-27T10:01:00Z
4,Pattern,Component,Atom,"Icon Loading Performance","Ensuring that icons, which can be numerous, do not negatively impact the application's initial load time.","Load icons dynamically using `React.lazy` and `import()`.","This pattern code-splits each icon, so the JavaScript for an icon is only fetched from the server when the icon is first rendered, rather than being part of the main bundle.",2025-06-27T10:02:00Z
