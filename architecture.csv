Architecture,Adapter,Module,adapter,"Encapsulates all external libraries (React, Styled-Components, etc.) and exposes a consistent, single-word API to the application.","react, react-dom, styled-components","This is a crucial performance and maintenance pattern. It centralizes external dependencies, allowing for easier upgrades or swaps.","'adapter' is the standard term for a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together."
