Context,Module,Type,Name,Responsibility,Dependency,PerformanceNote,NamingRationale
UI,Shell,Component,App,The root component that orchestrates the entire application layout and state.,-,"Must handle initial load efficiently, lazy load modules.","'App' is the universally understood single-word term for the primary application container."
UI,Core,Token,theme,"Provides a single source of truth for all design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) to ensure UI consistency.",-,"Should be a static object, no computation. Tree-shakable.","'theme' is the standard single-word for a design system's style object."
UI,Atom,Component,Icon,"Renders a specific SVG icon based on a `name` prop, decoupling icon assets from components that use them.","react, `assets/*.svg`","Uses React.lazy for dynamic import, so icons are only loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size.","'Icon' is the direct, single-word representation of a graphical symbol."
UI,Atom,Component,Button,"A versatile button component supporting different variants, sizes, and states, with optional prefix/suffix icons.","Adapter, Core (Theme), UI (Icon)","Styled-component creation has a minor overhead; variants are optimized with `css` helper.","'Button' is the fundamental, single-word term for a clickable UI element."
UI,Atom,Component,Card,"A container component that displays content with a configurable shadow to create elevation.","Adapter, Core (Theme)","The `box-shadow` property can be performance-intensive; transitions are included.","'Card' is a standard term for self-contained UI surfaces."
UI,Atom,Module,Typography,"A module providing a set of components (Title, Subtitle, Text) for rendering text with consistent, theme-driven styles.","Adapter, Core (Theme)","Inheritance in styled-components is used to minimize style duplication.","'Typography' as a module and semantic names (Title, Text) for components provide clear context."
UI,Atom,Component,Swatch,"A component to visually display a color sample, its name, and its hex code, used for the style guide.","Adapter, Core (Theme)","A simple, focused component for a single purpose.","'Swatch' is the standard, single-word industry term for a color sample."
UI,Atom,Component,Logo,"A dynamic component that renders the correct logo SVG variant (icon/full, light/dark) based on props, using code-splitting for performance.",Adapter,Theme,"SVGs are loaded lazily to minimize bundle size and maximize flexibility.","'Logo' is a single, unambiguous word for the brand asset."
Architecture,Adapter,Module,adapter,"Encapsulates all external libraries (React, Styled-Components, etc.) and exposes a consistent, single-word API to the application.","react, react-dom, styled-components","This is a crucial performance and maintenance pattern. It centralizes external dependencies, allowing for easier upgrades or swaps.","'adapter' is the standard term for a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together."
